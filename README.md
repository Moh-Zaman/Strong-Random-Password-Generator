## Credits

I have used Stack overflow forum to learn about how to call from functions since data is stored locally so is diffcult to access on a global scale. Futhermore, there are also cool ways to concatinate arrays instead of the standard methods. You can see from my commits that there are a lot of logic changes after doing some research and gaining knowledge from others.
